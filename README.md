# Sudoku Solver

I am creating a C# WPF application that solves sudoku puzzles.

## Installation

The files are for a Visual Studio project so simply download it and open it in Visual Studio. 

As this is a WPF application, it will only work on Windows.

## Usage

Simply run the Visual Studio project, then click the 'Start' button on the GUI to solve the sudoku puzzle.

In the future, I want to implement it so a user can load a file that contains a puzzle, which can then be run. For now, its just set in the code (while I develop it).
